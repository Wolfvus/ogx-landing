OGX LANDING ROADMAP
===================

1. Bootstrapped Next.js 14 + TypeScript project with minimal config and inline data model.
2. Implemented finance-inspired dark theme, custom SVG icon set, and global CSS system.
3. Extracted reusable Hero component, added contact reach page, and centralized site constants.
4. Localized all content to Spanish, refreshed copy, and introduced neon CTA + social proof metrics.
5. Enhanced responsiveness: sticky header, larger hero portrait, wider section spacing, contact grids.
6. Added collapsible mobile nav, animated text links, and inline social chips beside the Omar Guerrero wordmark.
7. Installed react-icons dependency and replaced text labels (IG, TT, X) with actual social media icons (FaInstagram, FaTiktok, FaXTwitter) from react-icons/fa6 in the header social buttons. Increased brand name and social icon sizes across all breakpoints for better visibility.
8. Extracted header into reusable Header component (components/Header.tsx) with configurable navigation links, implemented across main and contact pages for consistent branding and navigation.
